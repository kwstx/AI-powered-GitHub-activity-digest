# GitCalm

GitCalm is your daily sanctuary for GitHub activity. It cuts through the noise of endless notifications by intelligently summarizing your repository events into a clean, visual dashboard. Focus on what matters: outcomes, blockers, and essential updates.

## Features

*   **Seamless Repo Connection**: Connect your GitHub account and select exactly which repositories you want to track.
*   **Visual Pulse Dashboard**: An interactive "Bubble Chart" gives you an instant health check of your projects:
    *   **Outcomes**: See merged PRs and completed work.
    *   **Attention**: Identify failed builds and critical issues immediately.
    *   **Updates**: Track general activity without the clutter.
*   **Intelligent Summarization**: Categorizes complex GitHub events (PRs, Issues, CI/CD) into human-readable summaries using smart keyword classification.
*   **Time-Travel Filtering**: View activity by "Today", "Last 7 Days", or custom ranges to zoom in on specific sprints or historical data.
*   **Daily Digest**: A simplified feed that prioritizes "Outcomes" and "Attention Items" over mundane logs.
*   **One-Click Reporting**: Generate and copy a Markdown summary of your day - perfect for daily standups or work logs.
